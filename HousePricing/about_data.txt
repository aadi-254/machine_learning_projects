🏠 California Housing Dataset – Column Meanings
1️⃣ longitude

Type: Numerical (float)

Meaning: East–West geographic location of the house

Insight: Helps identify proximity to coast/cities

Use in ML: ✅ Important (location matters)

2️⃣ latitude

Type: Numerical (float)

Meaning: North–South geographic location

Insight: Combined with longitude → strong price indicator

Use in ML: ✅ Important

3️⃣ housing_median_age

Type: Numerical

Meaning: Median age of houses in the block

Insight: Older houses may be cheaper or premium (depends on area)

Use in ML: ✅ Feature

4️⃣ total_rooms

Type: Numerical

Meaning: Total number of rooms in all houses in the block

Note: Raw value, not per house

Use in ML: ⚠️ Better after feature engineering

5️⃣ total_bedrooms

Type: Numerical

Meaning: Total number of bedrooms in the block

Missing values: Yes (needs filling)

Use in ML: ⚠️ Engineer ratio features

6️⃣ population

Type: Numerical

Meaning: Total population in the block

Insight: High population density may affect price

Use in ML: ✅ Feature

7️⃣ households

Type: Numerical

Meaning: Number of households in the block

Insight: Helps calculate room/people ratios

Use in ML: ✅ Feature

8️⃣ median_income

Type: Numerical

Meaning: Median income of households (in tens of thousands)

Example:

3.5 → $35,000

Insight: 🔥 STRONGEST predictor of house price

Use in ML: ✅ Very important

9️⃣ median_house_value 🎯

Type: Numerical

Meaning: Median house price (TARGET VARIABLE)

Max value: Capped at $500,000

Use in ML: 🎯 Label (y)

🔟 ocean_proximity

Type: Categorical

Meaning: Distance of the house from the ocean

Categories:

<1H OCEAN

INLAND

NEAR OCEAN

NEAR BAY

ISLAND

Insight: Houses closer to ocean are more expensive

Use in ML: ✅ Encode (One-H
